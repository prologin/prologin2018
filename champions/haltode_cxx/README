This IA is meant to try out cooperation between agents:
    - A pair of agents will work together throughout the game to get high
      capture points aliens: one agent is responsible of capturing the alien,
      and the other one to defend around.
    - The other two agents will work on their own, by trying to capture close
      aliens to make additional points.

# TODO

- coop_mode:
    - choose closest alien when the two selected have the same amount of points
    - improve radius approach to target 
    - careful to not block ourself
    - fix bug when agents do not push the ennemy
- solo mode:
    - annoy the ennemy when trying to capture important aliens
    - fix bug where solo targets are the same as the coop target
    - improve push
    - improve selection of next target
